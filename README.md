# Hi, I'm SARTHAK-RAUTELA

Welcome — this repository is my GitHub profile README. The generated Pacman SVG (created by the workflow) is embedded below so it appears on my profile.

  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SARTHAK-RAUTELA/SARTHAK-RAUTELA/main/assets/pacman.svg" alt="Pacman" width="920" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"/>
</p>

Notes
- The SVG is generated by the GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/pacman.yml` and will be committed to `assets/pacman.svg` on the `main` branch.
- To refresh the image, run the workflow manually from the Actions tab or wait for the scheduled run.
